modrana (0.53.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Sat Oct 10 2015 Martin Kolman <martin.kolman@gmail.com> - 0.53.1
  *  - point to point online routing is now supported in the Qt 5 GUI! :)
  *   - Frederik Ferner contributed the core Qt 5 GUI routing support code - thanks a lot! :-)
  *   - routing mode can be activated from the main menu by cliking the "Route" button
  *    - to end the routing mode, just presss the "clear" button
  *   - routing parameters can be confiogured in Options->Navigation
  *    - the car, walking and cycling routing mode can be set
  *    - avoiding of major highwais and toll roads can be toggled
  *  - GTK GUI should now properly refresh the map when it changes state
  *   - such as when switching overlays, switching network usage modes, when batch download finsihes, etc.
  *  - you can now double-click the map to zoom in both Qt 5 GUI and GTK GUI
  *  - you can now use the mause wheel to zoom the map in and out in both Qt 5 GUI and GTK GUI
  *  - various statistics are now shown during track recording
  *  - start using PyOtherSide 1.4 and Qt 5.4 for the Android package
  *   - this should fix a possible PyOtherSide crash at startup and adds Sqlite tile storage support on Android
  *   - thanks to Qt 5.4 the QtQuick controls (used through UC) now have a native Android theme
  *   - the compass rose now finally turns - also thanks to Qt 5.4 :)
  *  - use Sqlite tile storage by default on Android
  *  - prevent tile images from being indexed into the gallery on Android
  *  - make the persistent dictionary usage Python 2 & 3 compatible by using the nr. 2 marshal file format
  *   - this should make it possible to use the Qt 5 GUI (Python 3) and GTK GUI (Python 2) on a single system while sharing a single options file
  *   - Fedora is one such platform where this is useful
  *  - fix CLI mode
  *  - disable log output to stdout in CLI mode
  *  - Qt 5 GUI map screen performance should now be a bit impoved, as an unexpectedly costly debugging element has been removed
  *  - release media keys when the modRana window is not active on Sauilfish OS
  *  - notifications now work correctly in the Qt 5 GUI
  *  - make QML -> Python log forwarding more robust
  *  - the Qt 5 GUI can now properly use positioning data from GPSD
